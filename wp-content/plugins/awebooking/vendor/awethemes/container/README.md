This package same as [illuminate/container](https://github.com/illuminate/container) but has been modified
to without requires a huge of [contracts](https://github.com/illuminate/contracts)

## Installation

Via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require awethemes/container
```

## Why?

For someone working on non-Laravel project, don't want `illuminate/contracts` component.
